                  This principle helps depict an object's mass and momentum,
                  stretching the object's form as it accelerates, and then flattening and
                  widening as it decelerates. Imagine a rubber ball bouncing on a hard floor,
                  flattening out before springing away back up into the air.

                  Think of anticipation as visual foreshadowing of an action to
                  come. A cat coiling and wriggling before pouncing. Cocking an arm back before
                  throwing a ball. Robots move from position to position. Creatures rely on
                  preliminary motion to help gain leverage and power. Movement without
                  anticipation can seem stale and artificial.

                  Staging, in respect to our animations can best be described as
                  composition. Guiding the users eyes to the most important parts of the screen
                  through the use of motion.

                  Within CSS, there are two methods for creating animations:
                  transitions and keyframes. Transitions are based on a starting and ending value
                  that the browser animates between. But with keyframes, we can add animations in
                  stages, or poses.

                  Real objects don't have uniform density and mass, and thus will
                  accelerate and decelerate at different rates. Think of being in a car and having
                  our heads snapped back into the headrest as it accelerates. Or having our heads
                  bounced forwards if the driver slammed on the brakes. Without follow through or
                  overlapping action, we would remain static within the car as it changed speed.
                  By giving different parts of an object different velocities, our animations will
                  feel more authentic.

          <div class="card__front">

                  Also known as "ease-in" and "ease-out," this principle is based on the
                  fact that physical objects don't simply start and stop instantaneously. They
                  accelerate and decelerate. Slow in refers to the acceleration of an object, and slow
                  out refers to deceleration. By applying different values to our eases can change the
                  perception of size or mass of an object. We can make things seem zippier or more
                  cumbersome depending on the the profiles of the acceleration and deceleration.

                  It's said that nature doesn't make straight lines, and natural movements
                  are no exception. This is a bit trickier with the web's box model, but introducing
                  some arcs into the motion of objects can make them feel more natural.

                  Adding individual animations to separate pieces of a scene can help to
                  accentuate or strengthen the primary elements of the animation.

                  Objects should move at believable rates in comparison to their sizes and
                  mass. A semi-truck is going to accelerate and decelerate more slowly and evenly than a
                  Ferrari, which can get up to speed in the blink of an eye and stop on a dime. We
                  control the timing of objects both through their relative sizes, as well as  the
                  duration of an animation, as well as its ease-in and ease-out profiles.

                  While we're trying to keep our animations relatable, making them too
                  realistic can result in motion that is dry and unappealing. Pushing our the individual
                  principles of animation a bit beyond the natural limits can help to bestow them with
                  character and personality.

                  Traditionally, this principle refers to properly realizing a scene, such
                  as properly rendering perspective, etc. For us, this principle is all about properly
                  structuring our code for animation. It's critical that we understand the ins and outs
                  of the properties that we are using, in order to ensure that our animations are playing
                  back as desired.

                  In a word: Charisma. Adding small flourishes to our animations can help
                  make them more dynamic and engaging to our users.  The life of the party is the life
                  of the party because they attract the attention of the room. It's their appeal and
                  charisma that draws our attention to them and keeps it there.
